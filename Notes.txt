    Notes:
    ------

    revert: 
        Will revert only one specific commit. Will NOT affect other commits

    reset:
        Capable of PERMANENTLY deleting all work. Three double-dashed flags:
            1.  --mixed     Removes any commits occuring AFTER a specified commit
            2.  --soft      Just like --mixed, except the changed files remain in 
                            the staging area as "modified". To use these files in 
                            their modified state, they must be unstaged and then 
                            execute "git checkout ."
            3.  --hard      Removes any commits occuring AFTER a specified commit. 
                            Automatically updates files (no need to execute 
                            "git checkout .")

        **Note: These changes affect where the HEAD is - the files will still 
        appear as before, but with a "changed" status. To finish the reset, follow 
        up by typing "git checkout ."

    .gitignore:
        If attempting to ignore a file that has already been commited, you must 
        follow the .gitignore file entry with a " git reset ." and "git checkout ."

    Pushing to GitHub::
        1.  Enter "git remote add origin https://github.com/s2623J/Git-Course.git"
        2.  Then, enter "git push origin main"

    Pulling from GitHub:
        1.  Enter "git pull origin main"
        2.  Verify pulled changes via "git log --oneline"

    Branches:
        1.  Map GitHub & local branches together via "git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main"
        2.  Future pulls should only require entering "git pull"
